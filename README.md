##DECISION TREE REPRESENTATION

The decision tree can be considered not only an alternative and clearer view of the data, but also a useful classification tool and possibly prediction of the class of a data item.

The project I propose in the article shows the algorithm for generating the decision tree based on the training data.
The program aims to generate the classifier for any set of attributes and data, therefore it generates an n-ary decision tree for a target attribute that can have n labels.

The example considered in the main method is the classic one of the tennis match which is played based on some weather conditions, which decision tree is:
